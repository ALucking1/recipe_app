# RecipeApp
A ruby sinatra app that finds the current temperature in London and provides you with a suitable recipe.

## How does it work?
The app uses the OpenWeatherAPI to find the current temperature, which is then split into five groups from super cold to boiling hot and takes a random recipe from a predetermined selection. Refreshing the page returns a different recipe.
